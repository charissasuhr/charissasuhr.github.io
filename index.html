  <p>
    From the beautiful PNW, I am currently a design student living in Spokane, Washington.<br>

    I began as a Marketing major at Eastern Washington University. While I really enjoyed it, I did not feel fully satisfied. I live life wanting to “tweak” just about everything. This is why I chose to go in to design. I eventually switched my major to Visual Communication Design with a minor in Business Administration. I love learning how to successfully communicate ideas and problem solve through aesthetics. By the time I had finished my first User Experience class I knew that I had found my niche. I plan to graduate June 2020 with a Bachelor of Design in Visual Communications with a focus in Web Design and User Experience.<br>
    
    <span style="font-weight:bold">Here’s the Real Talk:</span>
    I am inspired to design effective, efficient, and fresh ways to communicate and problem solve between business and user. I aim to create and transform products and experiences that are aesthetically pleasing, technically refined, and sustainable. Human-centered Design is something that I am passionate about and look forward to continuing to be inspired by what we can create together.
